# Facebook-Cloning
Facebook cloning is a social engineering technique where scammers use your publically available Facebook info to create a fake copy of your profile. They don’t have to hack your Facebook profile, but they can still cause problems with their fake one.
Usually, they will try to add your existing friends to their list to reach as many people as possible. Then they can:
*Send malicious links to your friends
*Ask to loan them some money by presenting a fake story
*Try to extract your personal info from your friends. They might provide it to them thinking it is you. After getting this info, scammers can manipulate it and make the fake profile look even more convincing
*Use bait-and-switch techniques
*Compromise your reputation by posting something inappropriate to your friends or in public
*Try to shut down your real profile by reporting you.
While some people are more cautious, many may still accept suspicious friend requests. They might think that it’s your new legitimate profile, that you defriended them and want to be friends again, etc.
